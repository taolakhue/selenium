A successful Red Team intern at Mandiant should possess an understanding of both information security and computer science.

This is not a “press the ‘pwn’ button” type of job; this career is technical and challenging with opportunities to work in some of the most exciting areas of security consulting on extremely technical and challenging work. A typical job could be breaking into a segmented secure zone at a Fortune 500 bank, reverse engineering an application and encryption method in order to gain access to sensitive data, all without being detected. If you can exploit at scale while remaining stealthy, identify and exploit misconfigurations in network infrastructure, parse various types of output data, present relevant data in a digestible manner, think well outside the box, or are astute enough to quickly learn these skills, then you’re the type of consultant we’re looking for.
As a Mandiant intern, you’ll get hands-on experience with complex problems on a daily basis.

You are expected to quickly assimilate new information as you will face new client environments on a weekly or monthly basis. You will be expected to understand all the threat vectors to each environment and properly assess them. You will get to work with some of the best red teamers in the industry, causing you to develop new skills as you progress through your career. Are you up to the challenge?
What You Will Do:
Perform network penetration, web and mobile application testing, source code reviews, threat analysis, wireless network assessments, and social-engineering assessments
Develop comprehensive and accurate reports and presentations for both technical and executive audiences
Effectively communicate and discuss findings and strategy with internal stakeholders including leadership and technical team members
Recognize and safely utilize attacker tools, tactics, and procedures
Develop scripts, tools, or methodologies to enhance Mandiant’s red teaming processes

Qualifications

Minimum Requirements:
1+ years’ experience, via internships, classes, projects and similar, in at least three of the following:
Network penetration testing and manipulation of network infrastructure
Mobile and/or web application assessments
Email, phone, or physical social-engineering assessments
Shell scripting or automation of simple tasks using Perl, Python, or Ruby

Developing applications in C#, ASP, .NET, ObjectiveC, Go, or Java (J2EE)

Source code review for control flow and security flaws
1+ years’ exposure working with tools used for wireless, web application, and network security testing
Understanding of network protocols, data on the wire, and covert channels
Understanding of Unix/Linux/Mac/Windows operating systems, including bash and Powershell
Must be eligible to work in Canada without sponsorship
Preferred Qualifications:
Prior experience in a technical security internship
Experience in security competitions, CTFs and/or testing platforms such as Hack the Box, TryHackMe, Overthewire, etc
Related projects around cybersecurity, programming, etc
Strong technical acumen and ability to quickly assimilate new information
Ability to successfully interface with clients (internal and external) and manage expectations of others
Ability to document and explain technical details in a concise, understandable manner

This internship will provide you with an excellent opportunity for learning and personal development, especially if you wish to gain exposure to global capital markets, and the critical real-time financial data needed and utilized to move key business lines forward. Throughout your term you’ll also have access to skill-building modules, as well as challenging work-integrated learnings - all of which come together to create a stimulating environment where you will have the chance to thrive. We want you to be a sponge and take it all in, bring your great attitude, always be authentic, and own every opportunity that comes your way. This is your time to shine.
How do I Apply?
For students, we believe evaluating you through relationships over resumes, and are focused on learning about who you are and what you’re interested in to uncover your true potential. In short, we don’t believe resumes will provide us with an accurate depiction of what you’re truly about in order to properly assess your potential. Instead we want to get to know YOU and hear about the experiences that have shaped you. We know… this might sound crazy but we do not want you to submit your resume instead we ask that as part of your application, you complete the below:
1) Complete your PLUM Profile here
2) Save your PLUM Profile as PDF. Click here to learn how
3) Complete a very short one-way video interview by clicking here (if you have already done this, you don't need to do it again)
4) When it prompts you to submit your resume, do not attach your resume! Instead, attach your most recent transcript and your PLUM profile in one PDF under the ""resume"" section. Cover letters are optional.
Note: You do not need to complete your PLUM profile or video interview multiple times if you are applying to multiple positions. Also, we have full access to your entire profile from Plum and won’t use the screenshot but it’s a great reminder for each of you to have completed it.
